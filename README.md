<h1 align="center"> IDM-Idle-Window-Fix</h1>

<p align ="center">Remove the annoying IDM idle window upon startup</p>

## Requirements

-   [Internet Download Manager (IDM) Extension](internetdownloadmanager.com) (For Full Version refer-> [HERE](https://github.com/bBSempai/IDM-Idle-Window-Fix/tree/master/IDM))
-   [AutoHotKey (AHK)](https://www.autohotkey.com)

## Instructions 

- Clone the repository or download the ZIP file. <br> 

```$ git clone https://github.com/bBSempai/IDM-Idle-Window-Fix.git```

- Install IDM if you haven't already.<br>For Crack -> Let CHROME run in background during installation so that it detects IDM and adds it to your extensions. Run Crack after.

- After installing IDM, it will already be in your autostart, meaning it will now launch automatically on boot. Stop that from happening by clicking [here.](https://www.betterhostreview.com/stop-programs-from-launching-automatically-windows-10.html) This is because we have to set up IDM Autostart manually.

- Install [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com) if you haven't already. Get a little familiar with it if possible :\

- Setup your AHK file according to the details provided in the [.AHK file](https://github.com/bBSempai/IDM-Idle-Window-Fix/blob/master/idm.ahk)

- Set your AHK file to run automatically on startup everytime you boot. If you already don't know how then just follow these instructions:

  - RUN shell:startup <br>
  
  <img src = "https://i.imgur.com/Umr4unL.jpeg" /> <br> 
  
  - It will open this directory -> (C:\Users\<NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup)

  - If the directory (Startup Folder) doesn't already exist...THEN MAKE ONE üôÇ 
  - Place your .AHK file **shortcut** in this directory. Now your AHK file will run on startup.
  
VOILA! It should work now check it out yourself by restarting your setup!
  
## Contributions

AHK is not supported in MacOS as of now. There is something called [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) which works for MacOS similar to AHK. <br>

Contributions regarding everything are most Welcome!
